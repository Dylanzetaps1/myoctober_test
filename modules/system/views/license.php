An alternately accessible domain can be used to initially develop the website, develop and test new features to the website, determine language translation or currency display or direct to a microsite as long as it is not operated as a separate website and does not violate any of the Terms of this EULA.</p>

<li><p>Any distribution of the Software without preliminary Author&#39;s consent, including noncommercial distribution, is regarded as a violation of this EULA and entails liability, according to the current law.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Unlicensed Software installations are intended for evaluation and testing purposes only. An unlicensed Software installation cannot be used for any publicly accessible website except the case when the installation is intended to demonstrate an October CMS Plugin or Theme, so long as the demonstration is not used to sell or accept payment for any product or service, or promote any product or service unrelated to October CMS Plugins and Themes.</p>

</li>
<li><p>This EULA may be terminated in case you delete all received files, associated databases, documents and their copies and completely uninstall the Software. Termination of this Agreement does not bind the Author over to return you the funds spent for the purchase of the Software.</p>
</li>
